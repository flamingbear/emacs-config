This is a collection of lisp files I have accumulated.

There are probably lots of places where I've cribbed information from the interwebs.  I don't intend to take credit for these things.  In some places I've credited when I remember, but originally this was just my emacs configuration, I didn't intend it to be shared with the public world, but I'm just too cheap to get my own github account.
