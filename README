This is a collection of lisp files I have accumulated.

There are probably lots of places and files I've cribbed from the interwebs.  I don't intend to take credit for these things, if you see something that is yours and I haven't credited you, please let me know and I'll fix it pronto.  In some places I've credited when I remember, but originally this was just my emacs configuration.

We're testing PRs in forge.
