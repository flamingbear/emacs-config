2011-09-17 This is where all of my emacs customizations go now.  This direcory is linked to ~/.emacs.d and then EMACS_HOME must be set to that directory.

;; A list of things that are not currently stored under version control, but
;; appear to be useful most of the time should go here:

flymake-node-jshint
nrepl
swank/slime* <= installed automatically with swank-clojure

But really I suppose you could read the .gitignore and see what I'm using.
